# Conda Recipes for Metagraph-related Projects

This repository contains recipes and Github Actions for building custom conda
packages of 3rd party projects.  These recipes are not on conda-forge for
various reasons, such as building pre-release or patched/forked versions of
these projects (noted below).

Recipes include:

* pyMLIR: https://github.com/spcl/pymlir
* MLIR (LLVM w/ MLIR project enabled): https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/
* IREE: https://github.com/google/iree
